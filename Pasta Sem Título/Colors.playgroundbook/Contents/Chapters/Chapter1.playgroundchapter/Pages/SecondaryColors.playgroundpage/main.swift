 # Secondary colors
 From yellow, blue and red, we can reach orange, purple and green, the so-called **secondary colors**. So, let's look at the mixtures that resulted in these non-pure tones:
 
 ### Mixture of colors:
  * Orange is the result of the combination of yellow and red.
  * Green is the result of the combination of blue and yellow.
  * Purple (or violet) is the result of a mixture of red and blue colors.
 
 * Experiment:
  With all these in mind, try to do the activity:
  
      1. Tap to Run My Code
      2. Tap on the primary colors and will show you the resulting color.
      3. Have fun, repeat until all colors appear. ðŸŽ‰
