 ### A little about myself
 Hi, my name is Beatriz Carlos, but they call me Bia. ðŸ§¡
 
 I'm a research intern at the **Apple Developer Academy - IFCE, Brasil**, and an undergraduate of **Computer science** at IFCE the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of CearÃ¡.
 
 It's amazing how colors can influence everything. I tried to teach in this playground the basic study of color theory and I was very excited to be able to talk about a hobby.
 
 Thank you! ðŸ§¡
